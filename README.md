## What is it?

**_It makes your Github contribution graph in Github pseudo-buzzing!_**

It sounds like a joke, but I seriously made a script to make Github's contributions pseudo-buzzing.

It's hard to imagine a situation where it would actually be useful, but why not dye your contribution graph green and take a picture of it?

## Why `Grass Nutrition`?

In Japan, the green rectangle in the graph is called `grass`.<br>
It's interesting, isn't it?
